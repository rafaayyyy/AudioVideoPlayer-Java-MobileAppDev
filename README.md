# AudioVideoPlayer-Java-MobileAppDev

This is an Android app built with Java in Android Studio that allows
users to play audio and video files. The app includes features to play
local media files as well as stream videos online. For streaming videos
online, the app uses both the WebView and Implicit Intent methods. The
WebView allows users to watch videos directly within the app while the
Implicit Intent method launches the device\'s default browser to stream
the video.

**Features**

-   Play local audio and video files of various formats from the
    project's directory.

-   Play videos through the WebView within the application.

-   Stream videos using the Implicit Intent method in the device\'s
    default browser.
